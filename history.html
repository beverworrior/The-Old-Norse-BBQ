            <h2>Thor</h2>
                <p>Thor, deity common to all the early Germanic peoples, a great warrior represented as a red-bearded, middle-aged man of enormous strength, an implacable foe to the harmful race of giants but benevolent toward mankind.</p>
            
            <h2>Odin</h2>
                <p>From earliest times Odin was a war god, and he appeared in heroic literature as the protector of heroes. Fallen warriors joined him in his palace, Valhalla. Odin was the great magician among the gods and was associated with runes. He was also the god of poets.</p>
           
            <h2>Loki</h2>
                <p>Loki, in Norse mythology, a cunning trickster who had the ability to change his shape and sex. Although his father was the giant Fárbauti, he was included among the Aesir (a tribe of gods).</p>
         
            <h2>Sif</h2>
                <p>In Norse mythology, Sif is a golden-haired goddess associated with earth. she is known for her golden hair and is married to the thunder god Thor.
                    The Prose Edda recounts that Sif once had her hair shorn by Loki, and that Thor forced Loki to have a golden headpiece made for Sif, resulting in not only Sif's golden tresses but also five other objects for other gods.
                    Scholars have proposed that Sif's hair may represent fields of golden wheat.</p>
      
            <h2>Freyja</h2>
                <p>Freyja, (Old Norse: “Lady”), most renowned of the Norse goddesses, who was the sister and female counterpart of Freyr and was in charge of love, fertility, battle, and death. Her father was Njörd, the sea god.</p>
                
            <h2>Yggdrasil</h2>
                <p>In Norse mythology, Yggdrasill is an enormous ash tree that connects the nine worlds, including the underworld (Niflheim), the earth (Midgard), and the realm of the gods (Asgard). Yggdrasill is associated with both life and death: it acts as a gallows that the god Odin hangs himself from in order to gain mystical knowledge, and it is said to be the source of new life after Ragnarök (Doomsday), the catastrophic final war of the gods.</p>
            
            <h2>Hel</h2>
                <p>Hel, in Norse mythology, originally the name of the world of the dead; it later came to mean the goddess of death. Hel was one of the children of the trickster god Loki, and her kingdom was said to lie downward and northward. It was called Niflheim, or the World of Darkness, and appears to have been divided into several sections, one of which was Náströnd, the shore of corpses. </p>
        
            <h2>Jörmungandr</h2>
                <p>In Norse mythology, Jörmungandr (Old Norse: Jǫrmungandr, lit. 'the Vast 'gand'', see Etymology), also known as the Midgard Serpent or World Serpent (Old Norse: Miðgarðsormr), is an unfathomably large sea serpent or worm who dwells in the world sea, encircling the Earth (Midgard) and biting his own tail, an example of an ouroboros. As a result of it surrounding Midgard (the Earth) it is referred to as the World Serpent. When it releases its tail, Ragnarök (the final battle of the world) will begin.</p>
